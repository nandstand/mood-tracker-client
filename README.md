#### Simple Mood Tracker

Simple Mood Tracker is a calendar app for tracking your mood each day using color.  This is the frontend component of the full stack app that I developed as part of a final project at the University of New Orleans for the class Developing Advanced Web Applications. The motivation behind this project was to gain hands-on experience in creating a full stack web app from end to end.

##### Features:
- **Calendar Interface**: Navigate through the calendar and select dates.
- **Color Picker**: Choose a color that corresponds to your mood for the selected day.

##### What I learned:
- **HTML5**: Used modern HTML tags and attributes to create the layout for the single page app.
- **CSS3**: Applied responsive design principles and utilized Bootstrap for styling. Leveraged CSS animations to enhance UX.
- **JavaScript**: Employed various techniques including:
    - **Event Handling**: Used addEventListener to manage user interactions like clicks and hover effects.
    - **DOM Manipulation**: Created and altered HTML elements dynamically to update the calendar view.
    - **Asynchronous Programming**: Utilized Promises and Fetch API to make asynchronous requests to the backend.
- **API Integration**: Consumed backend API to retrieve and manipulate mood data.

##### Implementation Details:
- `index.html`: The main HTML file.
- `app.js`: Manages all client-side logic, including user interactions and state management. This includes handling API calls and managing the calendar's appearance.
- `styles.css`: Utilized Bootstrap and custom CSS.
